For those of you that would like to make your game publicly available through GitHub please fork this repo and push any work you are comfortable with sharing to it. Note, this is not required to be a part of Purple Monkey Game Jam, it is however a way for other to see what you are working on during or after the game jam.

If you are going to make a web-based game be sure to either work in or publish to a [gh-pages](http://pages.github.com/) branch.
